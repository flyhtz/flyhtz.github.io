            Hey there! I'm Tiemeuh, a software developer, and I want to share with you my journey of creating and hosting my portfolio on GitHub Pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            I set out to create a portfolio showcasing my skills and projects as a software developer. The first step was to design the portfolio website. I wanted it to look clean, modern, and professional. To achieve this, I created a simple HTML file with the necessary structure, such as the header, main content, and a navigation bar. I used CSS to style the page, choosing the "Poppins" font from Google Fonts to give it a neat appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            To host my portfolio, I decided to use GitHub Pages, a free hosting service provided by GitHub. This platform allows you to publish static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It's a great option for hosting personal projects like portfolios.
          </p>
          <p>
            To set up my portfolio on GitHub Pages, I followed these steps:
            I created a new public repository on GitHub with the name "tiemeuh-portfolio."
            Inside the repository, I uploaded my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, along with any assets, like images or icons, in the "assets" folder.
            In the repository's settings, I found the "GitHub Pages" section and selected the "main" branch as the source for my GitHub Pages site. This way, the content from the main branch of my repository would be used to publish the site. Once I saved the settings, my portfolio was live at https://tiemeuh.github.io/tiemeuh-portfolio/.  (not the correct url but u get the idea)
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, anyone can visit my portfolio and learn about my journey as a developer, my projects, and my interests. It's a great way to showcase my skills and connect with potential employers, collaborators, or fellow developers.
